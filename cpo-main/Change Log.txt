Change Log

2022-03-07: Rebuilding the code with REST API library "fastapi". The paths are close to the Charge Amps API as a start.
All user related functions are working with a database. The Authorize user function is also working. However the functions behind
Authorization wall is not properly tested. The Chargepoints Paths are being implemented but are not fully tested. Remote Start is
not working due to an AttributeError.

All previous code has been moved to the "legacy" folder.

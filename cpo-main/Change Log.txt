Change Log

2022-03-07: Rebuilding the code with REST API library "fastapi". The paths are close to the Charge Amps API as a start.
All user related functions are working with a database. The Authorize user function is also working. However the functions behind
Authorization wall is not properly tested. The Chargepoints Paths are being implemented but are not fully tested. Remote Start is
not working due to an AttributeError.

All previous code has been moved to the "legacy" folder.

2022-03-07: Successfully rebuilding the code. Remote Start/Stop now implemented. There needs to be a transaction ID
generated in either the API or the Remote Start function for the Stop function to work 100%. Implemented Trigger Message
which allows us to PUT a trigger request to the CP to send Status related Notifications. Status Notification,
Meter Values, Diagnostics Status and Firmware Status is the supported messages. There need to be a discussion regarding
how we continually get notifications from the CP. Either through schedule a set timer for the CP or to looping a tigger
message.

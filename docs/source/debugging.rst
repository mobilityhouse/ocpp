Debugging
=========

Python's default log level is ``logging.WARNING``. As a result most of the logs generated by this package are discarded.

To see the log output of this package lower the log level to ``logging.DEBUG``.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

However, this approach defines the log level for the complete logging system.
In other words: the log level of all dependencies is set to ``logging.DEBUG``.

To lower the logs for this package only use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    logging.getLogger('ocpp').setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)
    logging.getLogger('ocpp').addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

    a profile with ChargingProfilePurpose set to “ChargePointMaxProfile”.
    ChargePointMaxProfile can only be set at Charge Point ConnectorId 0.

    Default schedules for new transactions MAY be used to impose charging
    policies. An example could be a policy that prevents charging during
    the day. For schedules of this purpose, ChargingProfilePurpose SHALL
    be set to TxDefaultProfile. If TxDefaultProfile is set to ConnectorId 0,
    the TxDefaultProfile is applicable to all Connectors. If ConnectorId is
    set >0, it only applies to that specific connector. In the event a
    TxDefaultProfile for connector 0 is installed, and the Central
    System sends a new profile with ConnectorId >0, the TxDefaultProfile
    SHALL be replaced only for that specific connector.

    If a transaction-specific profile with purpose TxProfile is present,
    it SHALL overrule the default charging profile with purpose
    TxDefaultProfile for the duration of the current transaction only.
    After the transaction is stopped, the profile SHOULD be deleted.
    If there is no transaction active on the connector specified in a
    charging profile of type TxProfile, then the Charge Point SHALL
    discard it and return an error status in SetChargingProfileResponse.
    TxProfile SHALL only be set at Charge Point ConnectorId >0.

    It is not possible to set a ChargingProfile with purpose set to
    TxProfile without presence of an active transaction, or in advance of
    a transaction.

    In order to ensure that the updated charging profile applies only to the
    current transaction, the chargingProfilePurpose of the ChargingProfile
